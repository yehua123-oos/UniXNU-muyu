"""Audit the 27 line's configuration for hand-over damage.

Why this exists
---------------
The 27 line (iPadOS 27.0.1 / 24A446) was carried by many agents in sequence, with
different conventions. The failure mode is never a syntax error - toml parses fine
and the build runs - it is a *silent* disconnect:

  * a series file that is declared but was never committed, so the applied patch
    set is whatever the loader happens to glob;
  * a defconfig that is named but does not exist, so the build quietly falls back;
  * a boot argument whose parser was renamed, removed, or never committed, so the
    option is inert and the panel shows nothing - indistinguishable from "the code
    ran and did nothing";
  * a path that pointed at a file somebody deleted three hand-overs ago.

None of those fail the build. All of them cost a flash to discover. This script
turns each into a line of output.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/audit-27-config.py            # human report, exit 1 on FAIL
    python3 scripts/audit-27-config.py --quiet    # only FAIL lines + summary

Exit status: 0 = clean, 1 = at least one FAIL.
